## Objective of making this repo
As I have been a rare user of git and github I've decided to upload my programs *complete* or *incomplete*(will be mentioned, if any)
that I learn, either for my Software Lab or if I'm interested in that topic.
Most of the programs you'll find here would be of basic level. I've tried to put as many documentation in it as possible to make a beginner understand.
Feel free to pull request if you see something wrong/incomplete, and I'll accept it.
